## 💡 Inspiration
Many recommendation systems fail to capture dynamic user preferences in real-time, leading to irrelevant suggestions. Our goal was to build a system that adapts continuously.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Using AI & real-time data to tailor financial services to individual users
- Personalized Banking Product Recommendations (Loans, credit cards, investment plans)
- Targeted Merchant Offers & Discounts 
- Customized services /alerts for budgeting/saving
- Customized Insights  for Business insights & data-driven recommendations. 

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- Graph Neural Networks(GNN) capturing User-Product Relations
- Wide & Deep Learning for Hybrid Recommendations
- Reinforcement Learning(RL) for continuous Learning
- Real-time Recommendation Pipeline


## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- Data collection issues due to Customer data being distributed across multiple systems
- Token limit constraints affecting LLM usage
- Increased loading times caused by the computations demands of LLMs
